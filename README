lloconv
=======

This is a document convertor which uses LibreOfficeKit (formerly known as
liblibreoffice) for all the heavy lifting.

You need LibreOffice 4.2 or later for this to work.  LibreOffice 4.3 or
later will work better in many cases (more formats are supported and you
can specify options - 4.3.0rc1 is required for option support).

To use it, just run it with the input and output filenames - the format to
convert to is determined by the extension of the output filename.  E.g.:

$ ./lloconv essay.odt essay.html

The code checks for LibreOffice installed in /usr/lib/libreoffice/program
(which is where the Debian packages install to) and if it's not there, tries
/opt/libreoffice4.3/program (which is where the .debs from libreoffice.org
install to).  You can override this by setting environmental variable LO_PATH,
either to handle an install in another location, or to force a particular
install to be used if you have more than one copy installed, e.g.:

$ LO_PATH=/opt/libreoffice4.2/program
$ export LO_PATH

You should be aware that LibreOfficeKit is quite a new feature - if you
hit problems, please report them.
