lloconv
=======

This is a document convertor using liblibreoffice for all the heavy lifting.

You need LibreOffice 4.2 or later for this to work.

To use it, just run it with the input and output filenames - the format to
convert to is determined by the extension of the output filename.  E.g.:

$ ./lloconv essay.odt essay.html

You should be aware that liblibreoffice is currently somewhat experimental,
and hence so is lloconv.  Don't be surprised by the occasional crash.
